 ## üõí Online Shopping System

### üìú Project Description

The **Online Shopping System** is a comprehensive web-based application developed in **Java** that leverages **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. This system enables users to browse and purchase products online through a robust and scalable platform. It features a range of functionalities to manage product listings, process orders, and handle user accounts, all built using core OOP concepts.

### üí° Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login with features for managing accounts, password recovery, and profile updates.
- **Product Catalog**: A dynamic product catalog that supports browsing and searching for products by various attributes.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add items to their cart, view cart contents, and adjust quantities before proceeding to checkout.
- **Checkout Process**: A streamlined checkout process that includes order review, address entry, payment processing, and order confirmation.
- **Order Management**: Admin interface for managing product listings, processing orders, and viewing order history.
- **Payment Integration**: Integration with payment gateways for processing transactions securely.
- **Responsive Design**: A user-friendly interface that adapts to different devices and screen sizes.

### üõ† Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java, utilizing OOP principles such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Front-end**: Java-based technologies such as JavaFX for building the user interface or integrating with web technologies if needed.
- **Back-end**: Java with frameworks like Spring Boot for handling business logic, API development, and database interactions.
- **Database**: SQL-based databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL for storing user and product data.
- **Payment Gateway**: Integration with payment processing services like Stripe or PayPal.
- **Hosting**: Deployment on cloud platforms or traditional web servers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Online-shopping-system.git
   ```
## üõ† Object-Oriented Programming Principles

### üì¶ Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components and can prevent the accidental modification of data. 

**Example in the Project:**
- The `User` class in our system encapsulates user details and methods for authentication, ensuring that user data is managed and protected.

### üè∑Ô∏è Abstraction

Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. This helps in reducing complexity and allows the programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level.

**Example in the Project:**
- The `PaymentProcessor` class abstracts away the complexity of different payment gateways, providing a simple interface for handling payments.

### üèóÔ∏è Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass). This allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.

**Example in the Project:**
- The `Product` class serves as a base class, and `Electronics` and `Clothing` classes inherit from it, reusing common product attributes while adding specific features.

### üîÑ Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to be used for different data types, and methods can behave differently based on the object they are invoked on.

**Example in the Project:**
- The `calculateTotal()` method in the `ShoppingCart` class uses polymorphism to handle different types of items (e.g., physical products and digital goods) and apply appropriate pricing logic.

### üß© Composition

Composition is a design principle where one class is composed of one or more objects of other classes. This is used to achieve a "has-a" relationship and allows for more flexible and reusable code.

**Example in the Project:**
- The `Order` class contains instances of `Product` and `User`, demonstrating how composition is used to model real-world relationships between entities.

### üåê Interfaces

Interfaces define a contract that classes can implement, specifying methods that must be provided. This allows for a form of abstraction and facilitates polymorphic behavior.

**Example in the Project:**
- The `PaymentGateway` interface defines methods for processing payments. Different implementations, like `StripeGateway` and `PayPalGateway`, adhere to this interface, allowing the system to support multiple payment methods.
